# CRONEX Operating System -- I am actually remaking this project atm! Maybe you'll get to see it on GitHub soon? ðŸ‘€

The ideal operating system environment! CRONEX OS is one of my biggest web projects, made to emulate the feel (or at least, look...) of an early operating system from around the era of
the 80's to the early two thousands. Made in JS with ReactJS. May implement some functionality using the WONDERS OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB
